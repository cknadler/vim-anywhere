# Open a temporary file with Vim. Once Vim is closed, copy the contents of that
# file to the system clipboard.

### Function definitions {{{

# Print out a message to stderr. {{{
#
# $1 the error message.
err() {
    echo -e "$@" 1>&2;
} # }}}

# Checks if a file exists. If it does not exit with an error. {{{
#
# $1 The filename.
# $2 A message which will be printed out on stderr if the file does not exist.
require_file_exists() {
  if [ ! -e $1 ]; then
    err "$1 does not exist. $2"
    exit 1

### Handle command-Line arguments/options {{{

while getopts ":v" opt; do
  case "$opt" in
    v) set -x ;;
    \?) echo "Invalid option: -$OPTARG" >&2 ;;
